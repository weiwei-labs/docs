# The Last Frontier of WEB 3.0: Digital Identity as SBT with UBI

Why is digital identity related to UBI, and should it exist as a pseudonymous e-residence?

- SBTs (Soul Bound Tokens) allow users to build a bridge between traditional services and WEB 3.0.
- Decentralized IDs allow people to manage their data with absolute independence.
- UBI (Universal Basic Income) for WEB 3.0 may be directly related to the value represented or created by individuals as a digital footprint, disrupting the traditional CPA model.
- Compliance in WEB 3.0 may exist as SBTs (Soul Bound Tokens) held by people and linked to their on-chain and off-chain assets.
- As global capital shifts from a centralized WEB 2.0 economic model to the decentralized WEB 3.0 paradigm, reliant on self-managed digital wallets, sovereign states could provide on-chain e-residences to stay competitive.

Digital identity is the last frontier being reshaped. The global markets have been affected by recent technological shifts. The introduction of decentralized digital currencies has disrupted the person-to-money relationship. The person-to-business connections are equally subjected to critical changes with the uprising of DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations). Our relationship with society and governments seems to be the next destination for structural disruption enabled by the new WEB 3.0 paradigm.

When it comes to the person-to-government relationship, the role of a decentralized digital identity is paramount.

When identity is linked to the estimated value of an individual, that amount can be paid as part of a Universal Basic Income (UBI), creating a direct relationship between identity and the UBI. A decentralized digital identity can be designed to be employed and issued by sovereign states and therefore must have a pseudonymous nature.

As a WEB 3.0 ZK-proof identity infrastructure, Weiwei Network offers a protocol for operating self-sovereign IDs, incentivized with UBI. Moreover, the protocol supports issuing of IDs for different entities. In this context, Weiwei Network is described as a decentralized CPA model.

Any commercial application connected to the Weiwei protocol can authenticate the loaded data. Using a digital wallet on the Weiwei protocol enables users to regain access in case of password loss.

Weiwei digital IDs open the doors to future opportunities for holders, especially for accessing necessary services such as remote bank account opening, e-SIM card purchase, business applications, mailbox renting, among many others. Digital IDs are stored on user wallets on the blockchain as non-transferable, non-fungible tokens represented by SBTs.

The adoption of Weiwei digital IDs may create a flow of new customers to compatible businesses and stimulate the development of the IT sector and the country's digital economy. The use of ZK technology in the Weiwei network guarantees encrypted and transparent data exchanges between all participants and users. As a fully decentralized service, Weiwei users can manage permissions individually to reveal and exchange data between network participants.

With the Weiwei network, all participants benefit from a secure exchange of personal user data. Companies from all sectors, such as gaming, travel, government agencies, commercial banks, crypto exchanges, and DeFi service providers, can rely on Weiwei for remote user identification procedures. The Weiwei technology serves as a bridge between WEB 2.0 and WEB 3.0 and becomes a catalyst for establishing a new societal relationship.
